## Work Experience

### Clinical Research Specialist
June 2021 - Current\
*Department of Diagnostic Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, University of
Maryland Baltimore - Baltimore, Maryland*

-   Functional MRI analysis to quantify cerebrovascular reactivity and
    look at functional differences between different patient groups,
    including HIV, Covid-19, and autism.

### Graduate Researcher
August 2020 - June 2021\
*Department of Radiology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine - Baltimore,
Maryland*

-   Focused on functional MRI analysis and using measures of
    cerebrovascular reactivity to tease out connections between
    structure and function within the brain.

-   Analyzed time series data with generalized linear models using
    in-house Matlab scripts and statistical parametric mapping software.

-   Presented findings at International Society for Magnetic Resonance
    in Medicine 2021 Annual Meeting.

### Research Assistant
September 2018 - June 2019\
*Department of Mathematics, Brigham Young University - Provo, Utah*

-   Wrote MatLab scripts to model properties of collagen lattices.

-   Ran statistical analysis on results of simulations of contraction in
    collagen lattices.

### Research Assistant
January 2016 - June 2019\
*Department of Chemical Engineering, Brigham Young University - Provo,
Utah*

-   Published results of research in peer-reviewed scientific journals
    and presented at numerous regional conferences.

-   Compiled and analyzed electrophysiological and behavioral data.

-   Drafted university-level grant applications and succeeded in
    securing over \$3000 in awards.

-   Supervised and trained a team of 10 students on proper aseptic
    technique, animal care, inhalation anesthesia, and requisite
    surgical techniques.

## Projects

### Visualizing COVID-19 Data
[Shiny App](https://lincolnck.shinyapps.io/covid_dashboard/), [GitHub
Repo](https://github.com/lincolnck/coronavirus_flexdashboard)

-   This project demonstrates the data visualization abilities of R and
    Flexdashboard by exploring global COVID-19 data.

-   The raw data was sourced from the JHU COVID-19 Data Repository and
    cleaned and processed for the various visualizations.

### Detecting Seizures in EEG Data
[Jupyter Notebook on GitHub](https://github.com/lincolnck/eeg_seizure)

-   Explored binary classification of seizure vs. non-seizure activity
    from EEG recordings, using Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest
    Neighbors, LSTM Network, Gaussian NB, and Random Forest models.

-   All models produced 10-fold cross-validation accuracy >95%.

-   Demonstrated feasibility of detecting seizure activity using SciKit,
    Keras and Python machine learning tools.

### Predicting Risk of School Violence
[Shiny App](https://lincolnck.shinyapps.io/school_crime/), [GitHub
Repo](https://github.com/lincolnck/school_crime)

-   Explored data published by the Department of Education relating to
    school crime, and compares the predictions different regression
    models generate predictions of violent incidents.

-   The various models are variants on the standard Poisson regression
    model, and account for interesting variability in the data that
    makes the standard model unsuitable.

-   This project was built in R, using various packages, and deployed on
    ShinyApps.
