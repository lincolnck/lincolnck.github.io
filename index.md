In *Life of an American Slave*, the author shares his initial experiences learning to read, the desire to do so brought on by hearing his master claim that in teaching a slave to read, "There would be no keeping him. It would forever unfit him to be a slave." Whether intended or not, this prophecy came true, at least in the case of the author in question - Frederick Douglass. In fact, Douglass, born into slavery in Maryland in 1817, escaped his captivity and went on to become a national leader in the Abolitionist movement of the mid-nineteenth century, and is quoted as saying, "Once you learn to read, you will be forever free."
